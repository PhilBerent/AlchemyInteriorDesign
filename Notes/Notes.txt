Ok great let have you make something for me. The images are in the directories we set up
The path is C:\Users\Phil\Documents\Laura\Temp Website\ and the sub directories are changed to those shown in the screen  shot.
Please give me code to create the following website
The main page should be headed "Alchemy Interior Design" and have the sub heading "Recent Projects"
The image on the home page should be the "page 1" image from C:\Users\Phil\Documents\Laura\Temp Website\New Jersey Country House directory.
The background should be black.
There should be a dropdown menu with the heading "Projects" which allows for the selection of the projects with the names of each of the sub directories.
On clicking one any project the user should be taken to the home page for that project
The project home page should have a heading of the name of the project for all but the "New Jersey Country House" project should display the page 1 image as close to full screen as possible while allowing the display the entire image with a 1/2" border on each. the "New Jersey Country House" project should start by displaying page 2. The background should be black. On each side of the screen there should be a simple arrow pointing respectively left or right to allow the user to page through the images for that project. For now lets just include the first 5 pages of images of each project, or in the case of the "New Jersey Country House" we should included images 2-6. Each project home page should also have an arrow labled "Back" at the top left of the screen which takes the user back to the home page
